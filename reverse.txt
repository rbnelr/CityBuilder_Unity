Reverse Engineering Cities 1:

Roads are meshes curved in shader with probably 2 beziers (left right edge)
->actually, since sidewalks can transition between different roads, maybe they do use more beziers?

2 Meshes:
	segment (road itself which can repeat)
	and node (a 'cap' that terminates any median meshes before the potential crosswalk)
	roads can probably be streched in X, but lanes, sidewaks etc. can not be adjusted without new mesh

UVs are adjusted for length of road (potentially seperate per side) meshes seemingly never
Road markings are part of road texture, crosswalks probably as well

tram tracks are a seperate mesh (which does not sink below road)

manholes and turn arrows are normal decals (projection boxes)

terrain clipping is magically not broken like in CS2 and my version, no idea how it works!
-> It's signed distance fields! What resolution? seems like it's enough to be accurate to less than a meter!
