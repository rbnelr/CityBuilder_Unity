-Add animation for gameobject vehicles

-render roads
 -draw lane markings?
 -draw props?
 
-raycasting for junctions + roads
 -> fix render bounds for junctions!
 
-add basic road building!
 -bulldoze (junctions / roads) [DEL hotkey] -> bulldoze via click + bulldoze selection?
  -if nothing selected: bulldoze becomes toggle, press 'selects' and release confirms while allowing click drag to delete paths?
  -if selection: button is press button and pressing deletes current selection
 -move junctions
 -move roads (allow individual control point movement + a more basic and constrained curve modify tool)
 -fix curved road building!

-make vehicles brake for vehicles on segments
-maybe try to port intersection code (if performance still acceptable)
 -port vehicles (and roads?) to ECS
 
-fix tangents!
 -likely need to write custom shader!

-constrain clac_curv better
-implement angled road ends?

-implement proper input consumption so inputs don't accidentally act twice
